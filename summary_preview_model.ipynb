While DeAndre Ayton is expected to return in about a month, this team needs to do a better job at the ball-handler positions, holding guys like Devin Booker, Ricky Rubio and Landry Shamet to 42 percent shooting.

The Pelicans (24-36) have had an ugly season, but they enter this matchup winning four of their last six games. This club has the best record in the NBA, but it was actually an uphill battle before a.500 run last year. New Orleans fans can't get enough of the play from Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram, and those two guys carried them during last year's MVP run. Many people thought this could be an issue because Lonzo Ball broke his hand, and it's sad to see him drop out of the MVP discussions. Players like Jrue Holiday, Jonas Valanciunas and CJ McCollum have been fantastic, but we haven't even discussed Zion and Brandon Ingram themselves. They need Brandon Ingram, though, because this club looks like a shell of itself in his absence.\n"

The Nuggets (15-12) come into this matchup winning four of their last five games, which followed up a stretch where Denver lost seven of its previous eight games. That's easily their best stretch of the season, with Denver posting a 6-2 record over their last 10 victories in total. What makes the season even more interesting is the fact that they've been doing that damage without Jamal Murray. The All-Star point guard continues to miss games due to COVID due to a heel issue and Denver has been battling to keep Murray as out of the lineup. It's easy to see why they've struggled with him but Nikola Jokic is keeping his foot on the gas. The big man is averaging nearly 25 points, 11 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game, and it's exciting to see this team\n",

They currently own the worst record in the Eastern Conference and look like a guarantee to finish dead-last in the conference. They're currently 12th in points allowed and 11th in offensive efficiency, while allowing the ninth-most points per game. They're doing this by forcing their opponents into three-pointers made over the last 20 games. That's an inexcusable stretch from such a talented team, and it's becoming clear that it's forced Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook into more complementary roles.

      "0: Portland Trail Blazers at Brooklyn Nets  January 4, 2022 at 07:30 PM The Portland Trail Blazers take on the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center on Monday night.  The Trail Blazers (19-24) have been surging in recent games, although their record may not be in line with their talent. Portland comes into Monday's contest having won five of their last six games, with its most recent success a 140-118 win over the Orlando Magic on Saturday night. Jerami Grant led the way with a 24-point, 10-rebound double-double that also included two assists and one steal. Anfernee Simons poured in 22 points, while Jusuf Nurkic generated an 18-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included two assists and two blocks. Drew Eubanks and Ben McLemore poured in 15 points apiece, with Eubanks adding five rebounds and five assists.  The Trail Blazers are likely to list Trendon Watford (ankle) as no better than questionable for Monday's game, while Justise Winslow (back) will remain out.  The Nets (16-24) have demonstrated some improved play of late with a 3-2 mark over their last five games, but they'll come into Monday's matchup in the midst of an extended losing streak as well. Their most recent stumble came at the hands of the Charlotte Hornets, which throttled them by a 130-106 score Saturday afternoon. Kevin Durant paced the Nets with 30 points, complementing them with seven rebounds, seven assists and two steals. Kyrie Irving generated a 30-point, 10-assist double-double that also included nine rebounds and one steal. Seth Curry matched Curry's scoring and also pulled down four rebounds. Bruce Brown supplied 10 points, five assists, three rebounds and one steal.  The Nets will likely list Seth Curry (ankle) as no better than questionable for Monday's game, while Ben Simmons (back) will remain out.  Monday's game marks the first of four meetings between the teams this season. The Trail Blazers won the 2020-21 three-game season series with the Nets by a 2-1 margin.      Portland Trail Blazers at Brooklyn Nets  January 4, 2022 at 7:30 PM The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the host Brooklyn Nets, 129-124, at Barclays Center on Monday evening.

      "2: Dallas Mavericks at Los Angeles Lakers  November 26, 2021 at 10:00 PM The Los Angeles Lakers play host to the Dallas Mavericks at Staples Center on Monday.   The Mavericks (7-5) come into this matchup winning three of their last four games. This marks their first game back home after a week trip, where they went 2-2, with wins over the Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors. What is strange about the Mavs home/away splits is that they are always playing well outside of home. The home team is much more competitive when playing at home but it's really hard to do that when they're out there against one of the worst defenses in the NBA. Luka Doncic is the leader of that offense, averaging a league-best 28.7 points per game. Those 26.6 rebounds per game have skyrocketed his game recently, winning all four matchups with the Mavs this season.   The Lakers (12-3) have been the biggest surprise in the NBA this season. They have the best record in the NBA, but it's hard to put that into words. Los Angeles has been one of the biggest surprises of the NBA, and it has them right back in it. In fact, the Lakers are now 4-1 in their last five games while winning their last two outings. That has them battling for the final three-seed in the west, which is really strange to say from a team that many experts consider one of the best teams in the NBA. It's hard to understand why this team has been so successful, but they look poised to keep winning if they keep adding to their impressive 7-1 home record.   Dallas swept the two-game season series over Los Angeles last year, winning each by at least 19 points apiece. Before that, the Lakers won 25 of their previous 28 games over the Mavs dating back to 2012.      Dallas Mavericks at Los Angeles Lakers  November 26, 2021 at 10:00 PM The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the visiting Dallas Mavericks, 130-96, at Staples Center on Monday.   Los Angeles took control in this game behind a 38-26 first quarter and rode a 40-26 second quarter to a nine-point halftime lead. The Lakers actually had five offensive rebounds gain in that span while the Mavericks won just one offensive rebound. Los Angeles shot 47 percent from the field, 36 percent from three-point range and\n",

The Celtics (35-14) are coming off a 98-95 loss against the Miami Heat on Tuesday. Jayson Tatum finished with 31 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists for the Celtics, while Derrick White ended with 23 points, six assists and three rebounds. Payton Pritchard ended with 10 points, seven rebounds and four assists, and Robert Williams III posted 11 points with eight rebounds. Grant Williams finished with 10 points and four boards as well. Boston has lost two games in a row against Eastern Conference opponents in the Orlando Magic and the Heat, but they still remain one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference. Boston has also gone 18-5 at home. Marcus Smart (ankle) and Danilo Gallinari (knee) are out for Thursday’s game. The Knicks (26-23) are coming off a 105-103 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, and that win snapped the team’s three-game losing streak. Julius Randle paced the Knicks in that win with a 36-point, 13-rebound double-double that also included four assists. RJ Barrett supplied 16 points, four rebounds, one assist, one block and one steal. Jalen Brunson registered 14 points, four assists, two boards and one steal. Obi Toppin turned in 11 points and three rebounds. Quentin Grimes recorded 10 points, three assists, one rebound and one block. New York has gone 14-10 on the road this season. Evan Fournier (personal) has been listed as a game-time decision for Thursday, while Mitchell Robinson (thumb) is out.      New York Knicks at Boston Celtics January 26, 2023 at 7:30 PM The New York Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics, 111-107, at TD Garden on Thursday.  The Knicks (27-23) recorded one of their best performances of the season in this game and dominated the Celtics (35-15), though Boston was much better, though not necessarily by much. The Celtics grabbed the lead in the first quarter (28-23) but they bolstered that advantage following a 27-14 score in the second quarter. New York would eventually turn things around in the third quarter and outscored the Celtics 38-22 in the third quarter, building a double-digit lead and racing out to an 11-point advantage following a 36-27 score in the first 12 minutes of the second half. Boston attempted a comeback and won the final 12 minutes by a 22-20 score, but it didn’t work and Boston won the final 12 minutes by a 25-18 score, but it’s been a complicated night with very few wins to show for it.  Julius Randle carried the Knicks and also had 20 points, 14 rebounds and five assists in 40 minutes of action, while RJ Barrett ended with 28 points and 12 rebounds. Immanuel Quickley had 18 points, and Quentin Grimes added 16 points as well. Mitchell Robinson posted 11 points, five boards and three assists. Jalen Brunson recorded 18 points and four boards while coming off the bench.  Jayson Tatum also had a double-double and finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists across 36 minutes. Robert Williams III ended with 13 points and 12 rebounds, and Payton Pritchard had 11 points and three dimes coming off the bench. Marcus Smart had 10 points. Grant Williams ended with 13 points and seven rebounds off the bench.      \n"
